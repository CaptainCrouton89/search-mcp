# Evidence Framework for Memory-Augmented Multi-Agent Systems Research

## Quality Thresholds

### Quantitative Evidence
- **High Confidence**: Peer-reviewed papers with experimental validation, n > 100, statistical significance p < 0.01
- **Medium Confidence**: Peer-reviewed papers with limited experimental validation, n = 10-100, p < 0.05
- **Low Confidence**: Preprints, theoretical papers, small-scale studies n < 10

### Qualitative Evidence
- **High Confidence**: Multiple independent confirmations, established theoretical frameworks
- **Medium Confidence**: Single source with strong theoretical backing
- **Low Confidence**: Single source, limited theoretical support

### Observational Evidence
- **High Confidence**: Consistent patterns across multiple studies/implementations
- **Medium Confidence**: Pattern observed in 2-3 independent sources
- **Low Confidence**: Single observation or anecdotal evidence

## Bias Sources to Monitor

1. **Publication Bias**: Preference for positive results
2. **Recency Bias**: Overweighting recent papers
3. **Citation Bias**: Overweighting highly cited papers
4. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking evidence that confirms hypotheses
5. **Availability Bias**: Relying on easily accessible papers

## Confidence Calculations

- **Triangulation Score**: (Quantitative + Qualitative + Observational) / 3
- **Evidence Strength**: Number of independent confirmations Ã— Quality score
- **Reliability Index**: Evidence strength adjusted for bias factors

## Analysis Structure

1. **Technical Architecture**: Focus on implementation details and system design
2. **Performance Metrics**: Quantitative results and benchmarks
3. **Theoretical Foundations**: Underlying principles and frameworks
4. **Practical Applications**: Real-world implementations and use cases
5. **Limitations and Challenges**: Critical analysis of constraints
6. **Future Directions**: Research gaps and opportunities
