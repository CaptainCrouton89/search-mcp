To search for issues and pull requests on GitHub using the GraphQL API with filters by type, state, repository, author, and assignee, you use the `search` connection with a query string that incorporates the relevant search qualifiers (e.g., `is:issue`, `is:pull-request`, `state:open`, `repo:owner/name`, `author:login`, `assignee:login`).

Here is a complete example query that searches for open issues or pull requests, filtered by repository, author, and assignee:

```graphql
query {
  search(query: "repo:owner/repo is:issue is:open author:username assignee:assigneeName", type: ISSUE, first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        ... on Issue {
          id
          title
          url
          state
          author {
            login
          }
          assignees(first: 5) {
            nodes {
              login
            }
          }
        }
        ... on PullRequest {
          id
          title
          url
          state
          author {
            login
          }
          assignees(first: 5) {
            nodes {
              login
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation and key points:

- Use `search` with `query` string combining filters:
  - `repo:owner/repo` to limit to a repository
  - `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` to filter type
  - `state:open` or `state:closed` for issue/PR state
  - `author:username` to filter by creator
  - `assignee:assigneeName` to filter by assignee
- The `type: ISSUE` parameter tells GitHub GraphQL API to search issues and pull requests.
- The response nodes use fragments `... on Issue` and `... on PullRequest` since search returns both types together; you can select fields accordingly.
- The example retrieves `id`, `title`, `url`, `state`, `author.login`, and assignees (limited to first 5).

Alternatively, if you want to fetch pull requests only from a specific repository and filter by state, you can use the repository's `pullRequests` connection:

```graphql
query {
  repository(owner: "owner", name: "repo") {
    pullRequests(last: 10, states: [OPEN], assignee: "assigneeName", author: "authorName") {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          url
          state
          author {
            login
          }
          assignees(first: 5) {
            nodes {
              login
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The `pullRequests` connection supports filters like `states`, but to filter by author or assignee here, you may need to apply client-side filtering or use the `search` approach which is more flexible for combined filters[1][3][5].
