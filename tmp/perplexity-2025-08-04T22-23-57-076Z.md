To search GitHub users with filters by location, language, followers, and repositories using GitHub's GraphQL API, you use the `search` query with `type: USER` and construct the query string with the corresponding search qualifiers. Below are complete example queries showing how to:

1. Search users filtered by location, programming language, minimum followers, and minimum repositories.
2. Query detailed repository information for a specific user.

### 1. User Search Query with Filters

The GitHub search allows filtering users by a query string with qualifiers like `location:`, `language:`, `followers:>N`, and `repos:>N`. In the GraphQL API, use the `search` field with type `USER`.

```graphql
query SearchUsers(
  $searchQuery: String!, 
  $first: Int = 10, 
  $after: String
) {
  search(query: $searchQuery, type: USER, first: $first, after: $after) {
    userCount
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
    }
    nodes {
      ... on User {
        login
        name
        location
        repositories {
          totalCount
        }
        followers {
          totalCount
        }
        avatarUrl
        url
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables example:**

```json
{
  "searchQuery": "location:San Francisco language:JavaScript followers:>50 repos:>10",
  "first": 5
}
```

This query returns up to 5 users located in San Francisco, who code in JavaScript, have more than 50 followers, and have more than 10 repositories.

### 2. Query to Fetch Repository Details of a User

Once you have a user login, you can fetch detailed info about their repositories, filtering or sorting as needed:

```graphql
query GetUserRepositories(
  $login: String!, 
  $first: Int = 10, 
  $after: String
) {
  user(login: $login) {
    repositories(first: $first, after: $after, orderBy: {field: STARGAZERS, direction: DESC}, ownerAffiliations: OWNER) {
      totalCount
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
      nodes {
        name
        description
        url
        stargazerCount
        forkCount
        primaryLanguage {
          name
          color
        }
        updatedAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables example:**

```json
{
  "login": "octocat",
  "first": 5
}
```

This query lists the top 5 repositories (by stars) owned by user `octocat`, including language, stars, forks, description, and URL.

### Explanation and Notes

- The `search` query for users supports GitHub's [search qualifiers](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-users): `location`, `language`, `followers`, `repos` to perform advanced filtering.
- For repository details, querying under the user object is straightforward and can include sorting and pagination.
- Repository languages come from the `primaryLanguage` field or the `languages` connection for multiple languages[3][4].
- These examples build on GitHub's official GraphQL API schema and search syntax[3][5].

For more on forming search queries similar to GitHub UI, you can experiment with advanced search operators on GitHub.com and use the same in GraphQL search query strings[1][3].

If you want, I can generate ready-to-use cURL or JavaScript code examples to run these queries as well.
