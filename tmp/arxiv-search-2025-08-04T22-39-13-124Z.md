## 1. Local Poisson Deconvolution for Discrete Signals

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00824v1
**Authors:** Shayan Hundrieser, Tudor Manole, Danila Litskevich, Axel Munk
**Primary Category:** math.ST
**All Categories:** math.ST, stat.ME, stat.ML, stat.TH
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
We analyze the statistical problem of recovering an atomic signal, modeled as a discrete uniform distribution $\mu$, from a binned Poisson convolution model. This question is motivated, among others, by super-resolution laser microscopy applications, where precise estimation of $\mu$ provides insights into spatial formations of cellular protein assemblies. Our main results quantify the local minimax risk of estimating $\mu$ for a broad class of smooth convolution kernels. This local perspective enables us to sharply quantify optimal estimation rates as a function of the clustering structure of the underlying signal. Moreover, our results are expressed under a multiscale loss function, which reveals that different parts of the underlying signal can be recovered at different rates depending on their local geometry. Overall, these results paint an optimistic perspective on the Poisson deconvolution problem, showing that accurate recovery is achievable under a much broader class of signals than suggested by existing global minimax analyses. Beyond Poisson deconvolution, our results also allow us to establish the local minimax rate of parameter estimation in Gaussian mixture models with uniform weights. We apply our methods to experimental super-resolution microscopy data to identify the location and configuration of individual DNA origamis. In addition, we complement our findings with numerical experiments on runtime and statistical recovery that showcase the practical performance of our estimators and their trade-offs.

## 2. IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00823v1
**Authors:** Wenxuan Guo, Xiuwei Xu, Hang Yin, Ziwei Wang, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu
**Primary Category:** cs.CV
**All Categories:** cs.CV, cs.RO
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.

## 3. Cross-Dataset Semantic Segmentation Performance Analysis: Unifying NIST Point Cloud City Datasets for 3D Deep Learning

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00822v1
**Authors:** Alexander Nikitas Dimopoulos, Joseph Grasso
**Primary Category:** cs.CV
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

## 4. Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00821v1
**Authors:** Gautham Varma K, Mohd. Hashim Raza, Azaz Ahmad
**Primary Category:** cond-mat.mes-hall
**All Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.str-el
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to WSMs, but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.

## 5. Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00819v1
**Authors:** Jinsong Li, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Jiaqi Wang, Dahua Lin
**Primary Category:** cs.CL
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.

## 6. A Large Catalog of DA White Dwarf Characteristics Using SDSS and Gaia Observations

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00818v1
**Authors:** Nicole R. Crumpler, Vedant Chandra, Nadia L. Zakamska, Gautham Adamane Pallathadka, Stefan Arseneau, Nicola Gentile Fusillo, J. J. Hermes, Carles Badenes, Priyanka Chakraborty, Boris T. Gänsicke, Sean Morrison, Hans-Walter Rix, Stephen P. Schmidt, Axel Schwope, Keivan G. Stassun
**Primary Category:** astro-ph.SR
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
We present a catalog of 8545 and 19,257 unique DA white dwarfs observed in SDSS Data Release 19 and previous SDSS data releases, respectively. This is the largest catalog of both spectroscopic and photometric measurements of DA white dwarfs available to date, and we make this catalog and all code used to create it publicly available. We measure the apparent radial velocity, spectroscopic effective temperature and surface gravity, and photometric effective temperature and radius for all objects in our catalog. We validate our measurements against other published white dwarf catalogs. For apparent radial velocities, surface gravities, and effective temperatures measured from spectra with signal-to-noise ratios $&gt;50$, our measurements agree with published SDSS white dwarf catalogs to within 7.5 km/s, 0.060 dex, and $2.4\%$, respectively. For radii and effective temperatures measured with Gaia photometry, our measurements agree with other published Gaia datasets to within $0.0005$ $R_\odot$ and $3\%$, respectively. We use this catalog to investigate systematic discrepancies between white dwarfs observed in SDSS-V and previous generations of SDSS. For objects observed in both SDSS-V and previous generations, we uncover systematic differences between measured spectroscopic parameters depending on which set of survey data is used. On average, the measured apparent radial velocity of a DA white dwarf is $11.5$ km/s larger and the surface gravity is $0.015$ dex smaller when a white dwarf's spectroscopic parameters are measured using SDSS-V data compared to using data from previous generations of SDSS. These differences may be due to changes in the wavelength solution across survey generations.

## 7. Efficient Solving of Large Single Input Superstate Decomposable Markovian Decision Process

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00816v1
**Authors:** Youssef Ait El Mahjoub, Jean-Michel Fourneau, Salma Alouah
**Primary Category:** math.OC
**All Categories:** math.OC, cs.LG, cs.PF
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) remains a central challenge in sequential decision-making, especially when dealing with large state spaces and long-term optimization criteria. A key step in Bellman dynamic programming algorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in infinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward formulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation techniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting structural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a structured class of MDPs. We define the Single-Input Superstate Decomposable Markov Decision Process (SISDMDP), which combines Chiu's single-input decomposition with Robertazzi's single-cycle recurrence property. When a policy induces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into interacting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and efficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a scalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs.

## 8. Search for Dark Matter Scattering from Optically Levitated Nanoparticles

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00815v1
**Authors:** Yu-Han Tseng, T. W. Penny, Benjamin Siegel, Jiaxiang Wang, David C. Moore
**Primary Category:** hep-ex
**All Categories:** hep-ex, hep-ph, quant-ph
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
The development of levitated optomechanics has enabled precise force sensors that operate in the quantum measurement regime, opening up unique opportunities to search for new physics whose weak interactions may have evaded existing sensors. We demonstrate the detection of impulsive forces acting on optically levitated nanoparticles, where the dominant noise source is provided by measurement backaction. Using these sensors, we search for momentum transfers that may originate from scattering of passing particle-like dark matter. For dark matter that couples to Standard Model neutrons via a generic long-range interaction, this search constrains a range of models in the mass range 1-$10^7~\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$, placing upper limits on single neutron coupling strength as low as $\leq 1 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95% confidence level. We also demonstrate the ability of using the inherent directional sensitivity of these sensors to separate possible dark matter signals from backgrounds. Future extensions of the techniques developed here can enable searches for light dark matter and massive neutrinos that can reach sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond existing searches.

## 9. $ψ(2S)$ production in jets using NRQCD

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00814v1
**Authors:** Marston Copeland, Lin Dai, Yu Fu, Jyotirmoy Roy
**Primary Category:** hep-ph
**All Categories:** hep-ph, nucl-th
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Based on recent data from LHCb, we study $\psi(2S)$ production in jets using non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) in conjunction with the Fragmenting Jet Function (FJF) and Gluon Fragmentation Improved Pythia (GFIP) formalisms. Similar to previous studies of $J/\psi$ production in jets, our results show that these formalisms offer a much better description of data than the default Pythia+NRQCD prediction. We compare and contrast between the predictions from the FJF formalism and the GFIP approach. In addition, our results show that the distribution of $\psi(2S)$ in jets is an excellent discriminator to test different predictions for the $\psi(2S)$ LDMEs from various extractions. We find a large disparity between the predictions from three different collaborations showing that a more precise extraction of the $\psi(2S)$ LDMEs may be necessary.

## 10. Justified Representation: From Hare to Droop

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00811v1
**Authors:** Matthew M. Casey, Edith Elkind
**Primary Category:** cs.GT
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
The study of proportionality in multiwinner voting with approval ballots has received much attention in recent years. Typically, proportionality is captured by variants of the Justified Representation axiom, which say that cohesive groups of at least $\ell\cdot\frac{n}{k}$ voters (where $n$ is the total number of voters and $k$ is the desired number of winners) deserve $\ell$ representatives. The quantity $\frac{n}{k}$ is known as the Hare quota in the social choice literature. Another -- more demanding -- choice of quota is the Droop quota, defined as $\lfloor\frac{n}{k+1}\rfloor+1$. This quota is often used in multiwinner voting with ranked ballots: in algorithms such as Single Transferable Voting, and in proportionality axioms, such as Droop's Proportionality Criterion. A few authors have considered it in the context of approval ballots, but the existing analysis is far from comprehensive. The contribution of our work is a systematic study of JR-style axioms (and voting rules that satisfy them) defined using the Droop quota instead of the Hare quota. For each of the standard JR axioms (namely, JR, PJR, EJR, FPJR, FJR, PJR+ and EJR+), we identify a voting rule that satisfies the Droop version of this axiom. In some cases, it suffices to consider known rules (modifying the corresponding Hare proof, sometimes quite substantially), and in other cases it is necessary to modify the rules from prior work. Each axiom is more difficult to satisfy when defined using the Droop quota, so our results expand the frontier of satisfiable proportionality axioms. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental study, showing that for many probabilistic models of voter approvals, Droop JR/EJR+ are considerably more demanding than standard (Hare) JR/EJR+.

## 11. A JWST View of the Overmassive Black Hole in NGC 4486B

**arXiv ID:** 2505.14676v2
**Authors:** Behzad Tahmasebzadeh, Matthew A. Taylor, Monica Valluri, Haruka Yoshino, Eugene Vasiliev, Michael J. Drinkwater, Solveig Thompson, Kristen Dage, Patrick Côté, Laura Ferrarese, Tatsuya Akiba, Vivienne Baldassare, Misty C. Bentz, John P. Blakeslee, Holger Baumgardt, Youkyung Ko, Chengze Liu, Ann-Marie Madigan, Eric W. Peng, Joel Roediger, Kaixiang Wang, Tyrone E. Woods
**Primary Category:** astro-ph.GA
**Published:** 5/20/2025
**Updated:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M_{BH} = 3.6^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. Across all tested dynamical models, the inferred $M_{BH}/M_*$ ratio ranges from ~ 4-13%, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with $M_{DM}/M_{*} &lt; 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.

## 12. Proper-time functional renormalization in $O(N)$ scalar models coupled to gravity

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00807v1
**Authors:** Alfio Bonanno, Emiliano Glaviano, Gian Paolo Vacca
**Primary Category:** hep-th
**All Categories:** hep-th, gr-qc
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
We focus on the use of the functional Wilsonian renormalization group framework characterized by a proper time regulator and test its use in the search of the scaling solutions and the critical properties of an O(N)-invariant scalar field multiplet coupled to gravity in d=4 and d=3 dimensions. We employ the same background-fluctuation splitting and gauge fixing procedure, already adopted in a previous study based, instead, on the effective average action framework and a similar truncation of the effective action. Our main goal is to compare the results for the scaling solutions and some of the associated critical exponents. In this analysis, performed in a different framework, most of the picture previously uncovered is confirmed both at qualitative and quantitative level. There are, neverthelss, few differences both at finite N and in its large value limit, depending also on the schemes which in both frameworks are called 'improved'

## 13. Adacc: Adaptive Compression and Activation Checkpointing for LLM Memory Management

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00806v1
**Authors:** Ping Chen, Zhuohong Deng, Ping Li, Shuibing He, Hongzi Zhu, Yi Zheng, Zhefeng Wang, Baoxing Huai, Minyi Guo
**Primary Category:** cs.LG
**All Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DC
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate memory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework that combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the GPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific compression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of directly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We propose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best memory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training tensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the policy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that Adacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the Baseline.

## 14. Non-Trivial Renormalization of Spin-Boson Models with Supercritical Form Factors

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00805v1
**Authors:** Marco Falconi, Benjamin Hinrichs, Javier Valentín Martín
**Primary Category:** math-ph
**All Categories:** math-ph, math.FA, math.MP
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
In this paper we construct the non-trivial, renormalized Hamiltonian for a class of spin-boson models with supercritical form factors, including the one describing the Weisskopf-Wigner spontaneous emission. The renormalization is performed through both a self-energy and mass renormalization, in the so-called Hamiltonian formalism of constructive quantum field theory, implemented by a non-unitary dressing transformation. This solves the problem of triviality for unitarily-renormalized supercritical spin-boson models.

## 15. Online Fine-Tuning of Carbon Emission Predictions using Real-Time Recurrent Learning for State Space Models

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00804v1
**Authors:** Julian Lemmel, Manuel Kranzl, Adam Lamine, Philipp Neubauer, Radu Grosu, Sophie Neubauer
**Primary Category:** cs.CE
**All Categories:** cs.CE, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a new approach for fine-tuning the predictions of structured state space models (SSMs) at inference time using real-time recurrent learning. While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static during deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously updating model parameters in response to incoming data. We evaluate our approach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset collected from embedded automotive hardware. Experimental results show that our method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference, demonstrating its potential for dynamic, resource-constrained environments.
