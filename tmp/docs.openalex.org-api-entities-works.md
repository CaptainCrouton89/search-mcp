Journal articles, books, datasets, and theses

Works are scholarly documents like journal articles, books, datasets, and theses. OpenAlex indexes over 240M works, with about 50,000 added daily. You can access a work in the OpenAlex API like this:

* Get a list of OpenAlex works:`https://api.openalex.org/works`

That will return a list of `Work` object, describing everything OpenAlex knows about each work. We collect new works from many sources, including Crossref, PubMed, institutional and discipline-specific repositories (eg, arXiv). Many older works come from the now-defunct Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG).

Works are linked to other works via the `referenced_works` (outgoing citations), `cited_by_api_url` (incoming citations), and `related_works` properties.
