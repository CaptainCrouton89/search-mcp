## 1. Local Poisson Deconvolution for Discrete Signals

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00824v1
**Authors:** Shayan Hundrieser, Tudor Manole, Danila Litskevich, Axel Munk
**Primary Category:** math.ST
**All Categories:** math.ST, stat.ME, stat.ML, stat.TH
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
We analyze the statistical problem of recovering an atomic signal, modeled as a discrete uniform distribution $\mu$, from a binned Poisson convolution model. This question is motivated, among others, by super-resolution laser microscopy applications, where precise estimation of $\mu$ provides insights into spatial formations of cellular protein assemblies. Our main results quantify the local minimax risk of estimating $\mu$ for a broad class of smooth convolution kernels. This local perspective enables us to sharply quantify optimal estimation rates as a function of the clustering structure of the underlying signal. Moreover, our results are expressed under a multiscale loss function, which reveals that different parts of the underlying signal can be recovered at different rates depending on their local geometry. Overall, these results paint an optimistic perspective on the Poisson deconvolution problem, showing that accurate recovery is achievable under a much broader class of signals than suggested by existing global minimax analyses. Beyond Poisson deconvolution, our results also allow us to establish the local minimax rate of parameter estimation in Gaussian mixture models with uniform weights. We apply our methods to experimental super-resolution microscopy data to identify the location and configuration of individual DNA origamis. In addition, we complement our findings with numerical experiments on runtime and statistical recovery that showcase the practical performance of our estimators and their trade-offs.

## 2. IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00823v1
**Authors:** Wenxuan Guo, Xiuwei Xu, Hang Yin, Ziwei Wang, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu
**Primary Category:** cs.CV

**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.

## 3. Cross-Dataset Semantic Segmentation Performance Analysis: Unifying NIST Point Cloud City Datasets for 3D Deep Learning

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00822v1
**Authors:** Alexander Nikitas Dimopoulos, Joseph Grasso
**Primary Category:** cs.CV
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

## 4. Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00821v1
**Authors:** Gautham Varma K, Mohd. Hashim Raza, Azaz Ahmad
**Primary Category:** cond-mat.mes-hall
**All Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.str-el
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to WSMs, but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.

## 5. Mean curvature of direct image bundles

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00820v1
**Authors:** Kuang-Ru Wu
**Primary Category:** math.DG
**All Categories:** math.DG, math.CV
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Let $E\to X$ be a vector bundle of rank $r$ over a compact complex manifold $X$ of dimension $n$. It is known that if the line bundle $O_{P(E^*)}(1)$ over the projectivized bundle $P(E^*)$ is positive, then $E\otimes \det E$ is Nakano positive by the work of Berndtsson. In this paper, we give a subharmonic analogue. Let $p:P(E^*)\to X$ be the projection and $\alpha$ be a K\"ahler form on $X$. If the line bundle $O_{P(E^*)}(1)$ admits a metric $h$ with curvature $\Theta$ positive on every fiber and $\Theta^r\wedge p^*\alpha^{n-1}&gt; 0$, then $E\otimes \det E$ carries a Hermitian metric whose mean curvature is positive. As an application, we show that the following subharmonic analogue of the Griffiths conjecture is true: if the line bundle $O_{P(E^*)}(1)$ admits a metric $h$ with curvature $\Theta$ positive on every fiber and $\Theta^r\wedge p^*\alpha^{n-1}&gt; 0$, then $E$ carries a Hermitian metric with positive mean curvature.

## 6. Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00819v1
**Authors:** Jinsong Li, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Jiaqi Wang, Dahua Lin
**Primary Category:** cs.CL
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.

## 7. A Large Catalog of DA White Dwarf Characteristics Using SDSS and Gaia Observations

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00818v1
**Authors:** Nicole R. Crumpler, Vedant Chandra, Nadia L. Zakamska, Gautham Adamane Pallathadka, Stefan Arseneau, Nicola Gentile Fusillo, J. J. Hermes, Carles Badenes, Priyanka Chakraborty, Boris T. Gänsicke, Sean Morrison, Hans-Walter Rix, Stephen P. Schmidt, Axel Schwope, Keivan G. Stassun
**Primary Category:** astro-ph.SR
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
We present a catalog of 8545 and 19,257 unique DA white dwarfs observed in SDSS Data Release 19 and previous SDSS data releases, respectively. This is the largest catalog of both spectroscopic and photometric measurements of DA white dwarfs available to date, and we make this catalog and all code used to create it publicly available. We measure the apparent radial velocity, spectroscopic effective temperature and surface gravity, and photometric effective temperature and radius for all objects in our catalog. We validate our measurements against other published white dwarf catalogs. For apparent radial velocities, surface gravities, and effective temperatures measured from spectra with signal-to-noise ratios $&gt;50$, our measurements agree with published SDSS white dwarf catalogs to within 7.5 km/s, 0.060 dex, and $2.4\%$, respectively. For radii and effective temperatures measured with Gaia photometry, our measurements agree with other published Gaia datasets to within $0.0005$ $R_\odot$ and $3\%$, respectively. We use this catalog to investigate systematic discrepancies between white dwarfs observed in SDSS-V and previous generations of SDSS. For objects observed in both SDSS-V and previous generations, we uncover systematic differences between measured spectroscopic parameters depending on which set of survey data is used. On average, the measured apparent radial velocity of a DA white dwarf is $11.5$ km/s larger and the surface gravity is $0.015$ dex smaller when a white dwarf's spectroscopic parameters are measured using SDSS-V data compared to using data from previous generations of SDSS. These differences may be due to changes in the wavelength solution across survey generations.

## 8. String-based axial and helicity-flip GPDs: a comparison to lattice QCD

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00817v1
**Authors:** Florian Hechenberger, Kiminad A. Mamo, Ismail Zahed
**Primary Category:** hep-ph
**All Categories:** hep-ph, nucl-th
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
We construct an analytic, string based representation of the nucleon's axial and helicity flip conformal moments of generalized parton distributions that holds for any skewness and for both the quark and gluon channels. The starting point is the Mellin Barnes resummation of the conformal partial wave expansion, where the moments are parametrized by open (Reggeon) and closed string (Pomeron) trajectories with slopes determined by experimental form factors and meson/glueball spectroscopy. The forward limits are fixed by the empirical unpolarized and polarized parton distributions. Polynomiality, crossing symmetry and support are satisfied by construction. After NLO DGLAP ERBL evolution to $\mu=2$ GeV our analytic framework (i) reproduces some of the currently available lattice moments of $\mathbb{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathbb{H}}$ in the non singlet sector, (ii) predicts sea quark and gluon polarized moments that will be testable by forthcoming simulations and experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future EIC, and (iii) yields axial and helicity flip GPDs in $x$ space in reasonable agreement with lattice QCD.

## 9. Efficient Solving of Large Single Input Superstate Decomposable Markovian Decision Process

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00816v1
**Authors:** Youssef Ait El Mahjoub, Jean-Michel Fourneau, Salma Alouah
**Primary Category:** math.OC
**All Categories:** math.OC, cs.LG, cs.PF
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
Solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) remains a central challenge in sequential decision-making, especially when dealing with large state spaces and long-term optimization criteria. A key step in Bellman dynamic programming algorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in infinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward formulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation techniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting structural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a structured class of MDPs. We define the Single-Input Superstate Decomposable Markov Decision Process (SISDMDP), which combines Chiu's single-input decomposition with Robertazzi's single-cycle recurrence property. When a policy induces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into interacting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and efficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a scalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs.

## 10. Search for Dark Matter Scattering from Optically Levitated Nanoparticles

**arXiv ID:** 2508.00815v1
**Authors:** Yu-Han Tseng, T. W. Penny, Benjamin Siegel, Jiaxiang Wang, David C. Moore
**Primary Category:** hep-ex
**All Categories:** hep-ex, hep-ph, quant-ph
**Published:** 8/1/2025

**Abstract:**
The development of levitated optomechanics has enabled precise force sensors that operate in the quantum measurement regime, opening up unique opportunities to search for new physics whose weak interactions may have evaded existing sensors. We demonstrate the detection of impulsive forces acting on optically levitated nanoparticles, where the dominant noise source is provided by measurement backaction. Using these sensors, we search for momentum transfers that may originate from scattering of passing particle-like dark matter. For dark matter that couples to Standard Model neutrons via a generic long-range interaction, this search constrains a range of models in the mass range 1-$10^7~\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$, placing upper limits on single neutron coupling strength as low as $\leq 1 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95% confidence level. We also demonstrate the ability of using the inherent directional sensitivity of these sensors to separate possible dark matter signals from backgrounds. Future extensions of the techniques developed here can enable searches for light dark matter and massive neutrinos that can reach sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond existing searches.
