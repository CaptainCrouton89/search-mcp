An example of the OpenAlex API JSON response structure for a query on works typically includes fields such as the work's ID, title, type, publication year, authors, institutions, sources (journals or conferences), topics (concepts), publishers, funders, and pagination metadata.

Key parts of the JSON structure for a `works` response look like this:

- `id`: a unique OpenAlex ID for the work (e.g., "https://openalex.org/W1234567890")
- `title`: the work's title string
- `type`: type of work (e.g., "article", "book")
- `publication_year`: integer year of publication
- `authors`: a list of author objects, each containing:
  - `author` object with fields like `id`, `display_name`
  - `institutions`: list of affiliated institution objects (`id`, `display_name`, etc.)
- `host_venue`: the source where the work is published, with keys like `id`, `display_name`, and `publisher`
- `concepts` or `topics`: a list of applied subject concepts, each having `id`, `display_name`, and relevance score
- `funders`: a list of funding organizations with identifiers and names
- `counts_by_year`: an array of citation or other counts per year
- `ids`: external identifiers like DOI
- Pagination information including:
  - `meta`: includes `page`, `per_page`, and `total_results`

An example snippet (simplified) of a single work JSON might be:

```json
{
  "id": "https://openalex.org/W1234567890",
  "title": "Example Research Article",
  "type": "article",
  "publication_year": 2020,
  "authors": [
    {
      "author": {
        "id": "https://openalex.org/A123",
        "display_name": "Jane Doe"
      },
      "institutions": [
        {
          "id": "https://openalex.org/I456",
          "display_name": "Stanford University"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "host_venue": {
    "id": "https://openalex.org/S789",
    "display_name": "Journal of Examples",
    "publisher": {
      "id": "https://openalex.org/P135",
      "display_name": "Example Publisher"
    }
  },
  "concepts": [
    {
      "id": "https://openalex.org/C1",
      "display_name": "Machine Learning",
      "score": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "funders": [
    {
      "id": "https://openalex.org/F246",
      "display_name": "National Science Foundation"
    }
  ],
  "counts_by_year": [
    {"year": 2020, "count": 10},
    {"year": 2021, "count": 15}
  ],
  "ids": {
    "doi": "10.1234/example.doi"
  }
}
```

Pagination metadata is typically found at the top response level for queries returning multiple items, e.g.:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "count": 200,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 25
  },
  "results": [
    {...work1...},
    {...work2...}
  ]
}
```

This response format is consistent across entities like works, authors, institutions, sources, topics, publishers, and funders, with fields adapted to each entity type. For example, author objects include publications count and affiliations, institutions include location and type, sources include types such as journals or conferences, and funders include agency names.

For programmatic use, libraries like the R `openalexR` package retrieve the JSON and convert it into tidy data frames, as documented in [1][2]. The raw JSON response can be fetched directly via the OpenAlex REST API endpoints (e.g., `https://api.openalex.org/works?...`) and examined using JSON viewers or tools.

For direct exploration of JSON structure by entity, you can query OpenAlex API endpoints such as:

- Works: `https://api.openalex.org/works`
- Authors: `https://api.openalex.org/authors`
- Institutions: `https://api.openalex.org/institutions`
- Sources: `https://api.openalex.org/sources`
- Concepts/Topics: `https://api.openalex.org/concepts`
- Publishers: `https://api.openalex.org/publishers`
- Funders: `https://api.openalex.org/funders`

and parse the resulting JSON objects. The OpenAlex Quickstart tutorial provides examples of these queries with JSON responses [3].

In summary, the OpenAlex API JSON response for a works query contains nested objects representing all relevant bibliographic metadata, with authors linked to institutions, works linked to sources (journals), concepts as topics, and funders, all structured in a JSON array of results with accompanying pagination metadata.
