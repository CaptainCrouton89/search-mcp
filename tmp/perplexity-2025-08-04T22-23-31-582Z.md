Below is a complete example of a GitHub GraphQL API query for code search filtered by language, repository, file path, and file extension. GitHub's GraphQL API provides a `search` field accepting a `query` string with the same syntax as GitHub's code search â€” you combine filters like `repo:user/repo`, `language:LANG`, `path:some/path`, and file extension `.ext` to target results:

```graphql
query ($searchQuery: String!, $first: Int!) {
  search(query: $searchQuery, type: CODE, first: $first) {
    codeCount
    edges {
      node {
        ... on GitHubCode {
          repository {
            nameWithOwner
          }
          path
          textMatches {
            fragment
            highlights {
              text
            }
          }
          file {
            extension
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example variables to search code files written in JavaScript, in a specific repository, inside a given path, and with `.js` extension:

```json
{
  "searchQuery": "repo:octocat/Hello-World language:JavaScript path:/src extension:js your_search_term",
  "first": 10
}
```

### Explanation:

- `search` field performs a search across GitHub with parameters:
  - `query` uses GitHub's search qualifiers:  
    - `repo:octocat/Hello-World` restricts to a specific repo  
    - `language:JavaScript` filters by programming language  
    - `path:/src` limits results to files under `/src` directory  
    - `extension:js` limits results to `.js` files  
    - plus any text terms you want to search inside files
- `type: CODE` means we're doing a code search.
- `first: 10` limits results.
- `edges.node` contains match info with:
  - `repository.nameWithOwner` tells which repo the file belongs to.
  - `path` is the file path.
  - `textMatches` provides snippet matches.
  - `file.extension` confirms file extension.

This query structure leverages GitHub's GraphQL API's `search` capability for code, with filters applied in the `query` string parameter, not as separate GraphQL arguments.

For reference, GitHub's official GraphQL API documentation mentions the `search` type and its usage [GitHub Docs: GraphQL API - Search](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/search).

The approach aligns with typical usage of GraphQL code search in GitHub's API, as there aren't separate parameters for language, repo, etc., below the `query` string; filtering is done by composing a precise search string.

If you want to try live queries, consider using GitHub's GraphQL Explorer at https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer.

**Summary**: You filter by language, repository, path, and extension by composing a single search query string passed to the `search(query:..., type: CODE)` field, as in the example above.
