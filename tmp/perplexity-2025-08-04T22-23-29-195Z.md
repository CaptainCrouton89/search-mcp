The OpenAlex API exposes robust endpoints for interacting with scholarly metadata, supporting multiple entity types and offering powerful query parameters, filters, and utilities. Below is a comprehensive breakdown covering endpoints, entity types, available query and filter options, rate limits, and authentication support, primarily based on official OpenAlex technical documentation as of mid-2025.

**Entity Types and Endpoints**

The main OpenAlex API entity types (as seen in key endpoints and documentation) are:

- **Works:** Scholarly publications such as articles, preprints, books, etc.[2][5]
- **Authors:** People who have authored scholarly works.[4]
- **Institutions:** Research organizations (universities, research centers, etc.).
- **Sources:** Journals, conferences, and other publication venues.
- **Topics/Concepts:** Thematic or disciplinary keywords linked to works (named "topics", "keywords", "concepts").
- **Publishers:** Publishing organizations (distinct from Sources).
- **Funders:** Organizations funding research.

Each of these entity types is available as a collection endpoint (e.g., `/works`, `/authors`, `/institutions`, etc.), and usually as an autocomplete endpoint as well.[1]

**Core Endpoints (Selection & Patterns)**

- `/works`: Retrieve individual or lists of works (supports filtering, sorting, pagination).
- `/authors`, `/institutions`, `/sources`, `/publishers`, `/funders`: Parallel structure for browsing or querying these entities.
- `/autocomplete/<entity_type>?q=<query>`: Fast search for all major entities (useful for UI components)[1].
- `/text`: Process free text (title/abstract) to extract OpenAlex-assigned topics, keywords, or concepts[3].

**Query Parameters and Filtering**

Every entity endpoint supports powerful filtering and query construction via query string parameters, most notably:

- `filter`: Core parameter for filtering by any attribute (e.g., DOI, institution country, author ORCID, etc.). OpenAlex allows AND/OR/NOT logic within filters[2][4].
- `search`: Free-text search within the entity's records.
- `sort`: Sort results by specified fields (citation counts, date, etc.).
- `per-page`, `page`: Standard pagination controls.

**Examples of Filters for Works[2]:**
- `doi=<value>` — filter by DOI
- `authors.id=<OpenAlex author ID>` — works by a specific author
- `authorships.institutions.ror=<ROR ID>` — works affiliated with a specific institution
- `concepts.id=<Concept ID>` — works associated with a specific topic/concept
- `grants.funder=<Funder ID>` — works linked to a certain funder

**Examples of Filters for Authors[4]:**
- `has_orcid:true` — authors who have an ORCID
- `summary_stats.h_index:>20` — authors with H-index above 20
- `ids.openalex=<Author ID>` — filter by specific OpenAlex author
- `concepts.id=<Concept ID>` — authors associated with a discipline or topic

For complex needs, filters can be combined and negated using OpenAlex's logical operators (commas for AND, pipes for OR, and `!` for NOT)[2][4].

**Autocomplete and Text Analysis Endpoints[1][3]**

- **/autocomplete**: Fast querying for all major entities, returns entity suggestions matching the user's input string.
  - Example: `/autocomplete/institutions?q=flori` returns institutions matching "flori".
- **/text**: Tag arbitrary free text and receive OpenAlex topics, concepts, and keywords with confidence scores. Rate-limited to protect throughput[3].

**Rate Limits**

- The `/text` endpoints are explicitly documented as limited to 1 request per second and 1000 requests per day per user, to prevent abuse and ensure fair access[3].
- Other endpoints (such as `/works`, `/authors`, etc.) do not appear to have explicitly published hard rate limits as of August 2025, but users are recommended to respect typical API etiquette and monitor for any responses indicating throttling.

**Authentication**

- As of the latest documentation and user-facing API, **most OpenAlex API endpoints are publicly available and do not require authentication** for standard usage. No API key is needed for basic read operations for the entities described above, including autocomplete and text tagging endpoints[1][3]. However, users should check for future changes, as policies can evolve.

**Additional Notes and Advanced Usage**

- The Works endpoint not only supports filtering and listing but also provides rich metadata including the top 3 topics per work, so you can programmatically map works to fields or disciplines[5].
- While `/topics` and `/concepts` are sometimes used interchangeably in documentation, they represent hierarchical structures of scholarly subjects and keywords, so choose based on granularity.
- When filtering by entities like institutions or concepts, you can use OpenAlex IDs or external identifiers (ROR, MAG, DOI, ORCID, etc.).
- Advanced queries (across all entity endpoints) support range queries (e.g., `h_index:>10` or `year:2015-2020`).

**Summary Table of Core Endpoints**

| Entity Type        | Endpoint Pattern             | Autocomplete Support | Filter Example                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Works              | /works                      | Yes                 | `filter=doi:10.1038/s41586-022-04441-1` |
| Authors            | /authors                    | Yes                 | `filter=has_orcid:true`             |
| Institutions       | /institutions               | Yes                 | `filter=country_code:US`            |
